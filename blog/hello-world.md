Welcome to the V8 developer blog!

Historically, the V8 team has published blog posts that appeal to the wider web development audience on the [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/). In order to deliver more in-depth posts especially targeted to the hardcore coder and virtual machine enthusiasts out there, we’ve spun off this V8-specific blog. Big-ticket items will continue to be posted to the Chromium blog, but we hope you’ll stay tuned here for even more posts about advanced compiler techniques, low-level performance optimizations, and all the technical bits that make V8 tick.

Happy reading!
